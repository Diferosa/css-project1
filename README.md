# css-project1

I'm using this project as a practice exercise for what I've learned in The Odin Project, especially about CSS and Flexbox.

This page is structured using multiple <div> elements, each one representing a different section of the layout.
These sections are stacked vertically and styled with different background colors to clearly separate them.
I'm using this approach to better organize the content and apply Flexbox more effectively.
Throughout the project, Iâ€™ll refer to these <div> blocks as "sections" to make explanations and commits easier to understand.

problems

When zooming in too much, there are some problems flexing the page. I solved some of them, but I think to solve the others I have to be more advanced in the course. I will finish the last section and continue studying.
